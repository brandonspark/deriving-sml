The general change to the grammar looks like the following:

NEW:

options ::= { <id> = <id> (, <id> = <id>)* }

plugins ::= <id> [<options>] (, <id> [<options>])*



exp     ::= ...
          | [ %<id>: <tyident> [<options>]]

typdesc ::= ...
          | <typdesc> [ [@@deriving <plugins>] ]

datdesc ::= ...
          | <datdesc> [ [@@deriving <plugins>] ]

gonna need one for datatype replication too... ugh

dec     ::= ...
          | TYPE <typbinds> [ [@@deriving <plugins> ] ]
          | DATATYPE <datbinds> [<withtypee>] [ [@@deriving <plugins>] ]

gonna need one for datatype replication here too




- Can't do NJ extensions (in particular, functor syntactic sugar).
  - Not a big deal, except for the fact that we really should, for best usage
    experience
